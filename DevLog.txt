Got down to business. :D
Demarcated an area within the screen for the game, and god player movement within that region.
Also implemented a basic shot function, plus focusing and unfocusing.
I want better sprites.
Added a background object to control lives, bombs, and points. Will use from scene to scene. :D

Tomorrow: Start messing with enemy collision and player collision to bullets. It's a success if I can get both sides to die. Maybe get to work with power and item drops?
Power might be a problem...

Note for the future: SIMULATED HAS TO BE ON. ffs Unity.

Well, that ate all of my time. I'll work on player collision and items tomorrow. Maybe work on power, too.

Item collision done. Player-enemy unit collision also done. :D
