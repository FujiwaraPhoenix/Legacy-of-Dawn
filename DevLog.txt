Got down to business. :D
Demarcated an area within the screen for the game, and god player movement within that region.
Also implemented a basic shot function, plus focusing and unfocusing.
I want better sprites.
Added a background object to control lives, bombs, and points. Will use from scene to scene. :D

Tomorrow: Start messing with enemy collision and player collision to bullets. It's a success if I can get both sides to die. Maybe get to work with power and item drops?
Power might be a problem...
